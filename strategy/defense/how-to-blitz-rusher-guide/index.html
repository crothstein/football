            <h1>The Art of the Rush: Dominating the Line of Scrimmage</h1>

            <!-- TL;DR Box -->
            <div class="tldr-box">
                <strong>TL;DR</strong>
                <p>Pick your best flag puller (not fastest runner) as your Rusher. Teach them 3 techniques: the 7-Yard
                    Creep to time the snap, the Lane to force the QB inside, and the Breakdown to finish the sack.
                    Rotate 2-3 rushers to keep fresh legs on the field.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Most Disruptive Player on the Field</h2>

            <p>In 5v5 and 7v7 leagues, the Quarterback usually has 7 seconds to throw the ball. If you give them all 7
                seconds, they <em>will</em> find an open receiver.</p>

            <p>The only way to stop a good offense is to make the Quarterback uncomfortable. That is the job of
                <strong>The Rusher</strong>.</p>

            <p>Many coaches treat this position as an afterthought. They just pick the kid who has extra energy. But
                "The Rush" is a skill position, just like Quarterback.</p>

            <h2>Who Should Be Your Rusher?</h2>

            <p>A common debate among coaches is: "Do I send my fastest kid, or my best flag puller?"</p>

            <div class="coaches-tip">
                <strong>The Answer:</strong> Send your best flag puller.
            </div>

            <p>Speed helps, but it isn't everything. A fast kid who runs 100mph past the Quarterback is useless. You
                need a disciplined player who can:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time the snap perfectly.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Control their body speed.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Actually grab the flag when they get there.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="coaches-tip">
                <strong>Coach's Tip:</strong> Rotate your rushers. Rushing is exhausting. Have 2 or 3 players who know
                how to do it so you always have fresh legs chasing the QB.
            </div>

            <h2>3 Techniques for a Perfect Sack</h2>

            <p>Teach your rushers these three rules, and they will live in the backfield.</p>

            <div class="drill-block">
                <div class="drill-header">
                    <h3>1. The "7-Yard Creep" (The Start)</h3>
                    <span class="drill-time">Technique #1</span>
                </div>
                <p>In most leagues, the rusher must start 7 yards back from the line of scrimmage.</p>
                <ul class="drill-steps">
                    <li><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Standing flat-footed at the 7-yard marker.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Fix:</strong> Teach them to rock back and forth. As the QB begins the cadence
                        ("Down... Set..."), they should be leaning forward, ready to explode like a sprinter.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="drill-block">
                <div class="drill-header">
                    <h3>2. The "Lane" (The Path)</h3>
                    <span class="drill-time">Technique #2</span>
                </div>
                <p>Where you run matters as much as how fast you run.</p>
                <ul class="drill-steps">
                    <li><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Running straight at the QB's face. This allows the QB to easily
                        step to the side and run for a touchdown.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Fix:</strong> Rush to the upfield shoulder. Your goal is to force the QB inside
                        toward your other defenders, not let them escape to the sideline. Keep them in the "pocket."
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="drill-block">
                <div class="drill-header">
                    <h3>3. The "Breakdown" (The Finish)</h3>
                    <span class="drill-time">Technique #3</span>
                </div>
                <p>Getting to the QB is only half the battle. You have to finish.</p>
                <ul class="drill-steps">
                    <li><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Running full speed past the QB because they can't stop.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Fix:</strong> When the rusher gets within 2 yards of the QB, they must "Break Down"
                        (shorten their steps, chop their feet, widen their arms). This allows them to react if the QB
                        dodges left or right.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Visualizing the Blitz</h2>

            <p>Where you line up matters.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Middle Rush:</strong> Good for stopping runs, but harder to get sacks (the center is in the
                    way).</li>
                <li><strong>Side Rush:</strong> The best angle for sacks. Come from the QB's "blind side" (their back)
                    if possible.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Rush isn't just about getting sacks; it's about <strong>forcing bad throws</strong>. If your Rusher
                can make the QB throw off their back foot, your defense has already won the play.</p>
