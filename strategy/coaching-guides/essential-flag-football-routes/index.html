                <strong>The 5 Essential Routes</strong>
                <p>Every youth flag football team needs these 5 routes: the <strong>Go</strong> (straight deep),
                    <strong>Slant</strong> (3 steps then cut 45° to middle), <strong>Hitch</strong> (run 5-7 yards then
                    stop), <strong>Out</strong> (5 yards then 90° to sideline), and <strong>Post</strong> (deep then
                    angle to goal post). Master these and you can build any offense.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Stop Drawing Lines in the Dirt</h2>

            <p>The biggest mistake new coaches make is telling their players to "just run around and get open."</p>

            <p>In flag football, <strong>structure is speed</strong>. If your players know exactly where to run, they
                play faster. If your Quarterback knows exactly where the receiver will be, they throw accurately.</p>

            <p>You don't need the full NFL route tree. You only need these <strong>5 Essential Routes</strong> to build
                a championship offense.</p>

            <div class="coaches-tip">
                <strong>Coach's Tip:</strong> Kids forget routes in the huddle. The best way to fix this is to ensure
                the kids have the plays when they need them so they can look at their routes. <a

                </div>
                <p><strong>The Concept:</strong> The receiver runs in a straight line down the field as fast as they
                    can.</p>
                <h4>Why it Works:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stretches the Defense:</strong> It forces the safeties to back up, creating open space
                        underneath for your other players.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Deep Ball:</strong> If your receiver is faster than their defender, it's an easy
                        touchdown.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="drill-goal">
                    <strong>Coaching Cue:</strong> "Run straight like a track star. Don't look back for the ball until I

                </div>
                <p><strong>The Concept:</strong> Take 3 steps forward, then cut at a 45-degree angle toward the middle
                    of the field.</p>
                <h4>Why it Works:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Bread & Butter:</strong> This is the most common route in flag football. It crosses
                        the face of the defender, putting the receiver between the defender and the Quarterback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Yards After Catch (YAC):</strong> Because the receiver catches the ball while running at
                        full speed, they can often split the defense for a big gain.</li>
                </ul>

                    <strong>Coaching Cue:</strong> "Three steps up, then aim for the opposite goal post."

                <p><strong>The Concept:</strong> Run 5-7 yards fast, then slam on the brakes and turn around to face the
                    Quarterback.</p>
                <h4>Why it Works:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Beats the "Prevent":</strong> Defenders are terrified of the "Go" route, so they often
                        backpedal fast. The Hitch takes advantage of this cushion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy Completion:</strong> It gives your QB a stationary target, building their
                        confidence.</li>

                <div class="drill-goal">

                <p><strong>The Concept:</strong> Run 5 yards straight, then make a sharp 90-degree turn toward the
                    sideline (out of bounds).</p>
                <h4>Why it Works:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> If the QB misses the throw, the ball sails out of bounds. It's almost
                        impossible to intercept.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clock Management:</strong> In older leagues, getting out of bounds stops the clock.</li>

                    <li><strong>The Home Run:</strong> This is your big play. It attacks the deep middle of the field.
                        If the safety bites on a shallow route, the Post is wide open for a touchdown.</li>

            <h2>How to Teach These Routes (The Cone Drill)</h2>

            <p>Do not just explain routes on a whiteboard. Kids need to run them physically to learn them.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Set up Cones:</strong> Place cones at the "break points" (where they turn).</li>
                <li><strong>Walk Through:</strong> Have players walk the route first. Emphasize the "sharp cut" at the
                    cone.</li>
                <li><strong>Remove the Cones:</strong> Once they get it, take the cones away and have them run it on
                    air.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Put It All Together</h2>

            <p>Now that you know the routes, you need to combine them into plays. A "Slant" works best when it's paired
                with a "Hitch" on the other side.</p>

            <p>Use our <a href="/app.html">flag football play designer</a> to drag and drop these exact routes onto a
                digital field. You can color-code them (Red for Slant, Blue for Go) and print them out for your next
                practice.</p>
