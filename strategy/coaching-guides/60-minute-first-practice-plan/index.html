            <!-- TL;DR Box (Featured Snippet optimized) -->
            <div class="tldr-box">
                <strong>TL;DR</strong>
                <p>This 60-minute practice plan gives new coaches a complete, minute-by-minute script: 10 minutes for
                    introductions, 10 minutes for a warm-up game, 15 minutes for handoff drills, 15 minutes for
                    flag-pulling practice, 5 minutes for one offensive formation, and 5 minutes to end with a fun relay
                    race.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Don't Panic. Here is Your First Practice Script.</h2>

            <p>You volunteered because nobody else would. Now, practice is in two hours, you have a bag of flags, a
                whistle, and ten kids looking at you.</p>

            <p>Don't worry. You don't need to be an NFL coordinator to run a great first practice. You just need a plan.
            </p>

            <p>This guide outlines a strict, 60-minute schedule designed to keep kids moving, teach the basics, and—most
                importantly—establish you as the coach.</p>

            <div class="coaches-tip">
                <strong>Coach's Tip:</strong> Print this schedule and put it in your wristband. It shows the parents you
                are organized and keeps you on track. <a href="/app.html?mode=signup">Create a free Practice Wristband

                <div class="drill-header">
                    <h3>Introduction & The "Circle Up"</h3>
                    <span class="drill-time">0:00 – 0:10</span>
                </div>
                <div class="drill-goal">
                    <strong>Goal:</strong> Learn names and set expectations.
                </div>
                <p>Do not let kids run wild while you wait for stragglers. Blow the whistle and have everyone take a
                    knee in a circle.</p>
                <ul class="drill-steps">
                    <li><strong>Introductions:</strong> Have every kid say their name and their favorite NFL team.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> "When the coach speaks, the ball stops."</li>
                    <li><strong>Establish the Huddle:</strong> Show them how to circle up quickly when you yell
                        "Huddle!"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <div class="drill-header">
                    <h3>Warm-Up: The "Snap Reaction" Game</h3>
                    <span class="drill-time">0:10 – 0:20</span>
                </div>
                <div class="drill-goal">
                    <strong>Goal:</strong> Teach the Line of Scrimmage (LOS) and reaction time.
                </div>
                <p>In flag football, the play doesn't start until the ball moves. This drill prevents false starts and
                    gets them warmed up.</p>
                <ul class="drill-steps">
                    <li><strong>The Line:</strong> Line all players up on the Line of Scrimmage.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Cadence:</strong> You (the QB) stand in front. Yell random colors or numbers ("Blue!
                        42! Hut!").</li>
                    <li><strong>The Snap:</strong> Snap the ball (or clap your hands) at random times.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Rule:</strong> If they move <em>before</em> the snap: 3 pushups. If they move
                        <em>on</em> the snap: Sprint 5 yards or do high knees.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Make it fun:</strong> Try to trick them with "hard counts." This teaches discipline while
                    getting them active.</p>
            </div>

                </div>
                <div class="drill-goal">
                    <strong>Goal:</strong> Master the exchange and the "Pocket."

                    <p>📐 FlagSketch diagram: Two parallel lines of players facing each other</p>
                </div>

                <p>Most fumbles happen because the runner doesn't make a good target for the ball. We aren't worried
                    about QBs yet—we just want players to get comfortable holding the rock.</p>
                <ul class="drill-steps">
                    <li><strong>Two Lines:</strong> Form two lines of players facing each other, about 5 yards apart.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Pocket:</strong> Teach players to put their <strong>inside arm UP</strong> (elbow
                        high, across the chest) and <strong>outside arm DOWN</strong> (palm up). This creates a "pocket"
                        for the ball.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Exchange:</strong> Players run toward each other. The player with the ball firmly
                        presses it into the other player's stomach.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> After the handoff, join the back of the other line. Keep the cycle
                        moving fast.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="drill-goal">
                    <strong>Goal:</strong> Defensive fun and hip-tracking.
                </div>

                <p>Flag pulling is harder than it looks. This drill teaches players to watch the hips, not the head.</p>
                <ul class="drill-steps">
                    <li><strong>Set the Box:</strong> Use 4 cones to make a 10x10 yard square (The Ocean).</li>
                    <li><strong>The Shark:</strong> Put one defender (Shark) in the middle.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Minnows:</strong> The rest of the team stands on one line.</li>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> On "GO," Minnows try to run across the ocean. The Shark tries to pull
                        their flags. If your flag is pulled, you become a Shark next round.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Formation:</strong> "Spread" (Two receivers left, one right, one center/QB).</li>
