            <h1>The "8-Play" Rule: Why You Should Delete Half Your Playbook</h1>

            <!-- TL;DR Box -->
            <div class="tldr-box">
                <strong>TL;DR</strong>
                <p>Championship youth teams don't need 30 plays—they need 8 plays they can execute perfectly. This guide
                    shows you exactly which 8 plays to use: 3 runs and 5 passes that cover every situation you'll face.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>The "NFL Syndrome"</h2>

            <p>We see it all the time. A dedicated coach shows up to the first practice with a binder full of 30 complex
                plays. They have "Trips Right," "Spider 2 Y Banana," and four different motion packages.</p>

            <p>It looks impressive on paper. But on the field? It's a disaster.</p>

            <p>Kids—especially under 12—don't have the capacity to memorize 24 different route combinations. When they
                are confused, they play slow. And when they play slow, you lose.</p>

            <p><strong>The secret to winning youth flag football isn't variety. It's execution.</strong></p>

            <div class="coaches-tip">
                <strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> It is better to run 8 plays perfectly than 30 plays poorly.
            </div>

            <h2>The Solution: The 8-Play Wristband</h2>

            <p>Your core game plan should fit on a single wristband insert without tiny font. You need exactly eight
                plays to win a championship:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>5 Passing Concepts</strong> (to beat different defensive looks)</li>
                <li><strong>3 Run/Trick Plays</strong> (to keep the defense honest)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When you limit yourself to 8 plays, magical things happen:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> Your QB stops thinking and starts throwing.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Your receivers stop looking at you for help and start running routes full
                    speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> You can perfect these plays. If "Play #1" fails, you can tell the team
                    exactly why ("Johnny, you cut too early") rather than just moving on to "Play #2."</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The "Starter 8" Pack</h2>

            <p>You don't need to reinvent the wheel. These are the 8 fundamental plays that every championship team
                uses. We have pre-built these exact plays into our Starter Templates:</p>

                    <h4>5v5 Starter Plays</h4>
                    <p>Perfect for NFL Flag leagues</p>

                    <p>Balanced format plays</p>

            </div>

            <h3>The Running Game (3 Plays)</h3>

            <div class="drill-block">
                <div class="drill-header">
                    <h4>1. HB Dive</h4>
                    <span class="drill-time">Foundation</span>
                </div>
                <p>The foundation. A quick, direct handoff to the running back. It forces the defense to respect the
                    middle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="drill-block">
                <div class="drill-header">
                    <h4>2. Reverse</h4>
                    <span class="drill-time">Misdirection</span>
                </div>
                <p>The classic misdirection. Flow one way, hand it off the other way to the receiver coming around the
                    back.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="drill-block">
                <div class="drill-header">
                    <h4>3. Fake Reverse</h4>
                    <span class="drill-time">Counter</span>
                </div>
                <p>Once the defense bites on the Reverse, you fake the handoff and the QB keeps it for huge yards.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Passing Game (5 Plays)</h3>

            <div class="drill-block">
                <div class="drill-header">
                    <h4>4. Short Cross</h4>
                    <span class="drill-time">Safe Option</span>
                </div>
                <p>Quick, shallow crossing routes. This is your "safe" play that gets the ball out of the QB's hands
                    fast.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="drill-block">
                <div class="drill-header">
                    <h4>5. High Low Pass</h4>
                    <span class="drill-time">Sideline Attack</span>
                </div>
                <p>Attacks the sideline at two different depths (one short, one deep). It forces the corner to choose
                    who to guard—and they usually choose wrong.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="drill-block">
                <div class="drill-header">
                    <h4>6. Attack Deep</h4>
                    <span class="drill-time">Vertical Stretch</span>
                </div>
                <p>Everyone runs vertical. Stretches the defense and creates massive holes underneath or over the top.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="drill-block">
                <div class="drill-header">
                    <h4>7. Play Action Pass</h4>
                    <span class="drill-time">Deception</span>
                </div>
                <p>Fake the "HB Dive" to freeze the linebackers, then throw a pop pass behind them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="drill-block">
                <div class="drill-header">
                    <h4>8. Run/Pass Option</h4>
                    <span class="drill-time">Ultimate Weapon</span>
                </div>
                <p>The ultimate weapon. The QB rolls out with the option to run if it's open, or throw if the defender
                    commits.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>How to Implement This</h2>
